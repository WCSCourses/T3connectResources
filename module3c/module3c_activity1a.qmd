## **Explore the epidemiological data**

During sample collection, linked epidemiological data was recorded. Open the file [Epi_data.tsv](docs/Epi_data.tsv) with Excel and explore the data (note: patient names are made-up).

Q1. Can you identify data that is standardised/harmonised vs data that is not? Tip: Compare \"Isolation Date\" vs \"Patient Sex\". Would a computer interpret \"Patient Sex\" in the same way as a human would do?

Q2. Looking at the epi data only, is the key data available that will enable you to decide which wards will undergo enhanced cleaning if an outbreak is detected?Â

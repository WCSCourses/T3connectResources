This page provides resources designed and developed for the Data Viz workshop.

## **Workshop outline:**

1.  Discuss aspects of good storytelling. 

2.  Reflect on how one can use visualisation to tell a story about data.

3.  In groups, discuss what are the best visualisation methods for a given task

4.  Demonstrate how Microreact can be used to tell a story.

5.  In a hands-on exercise, apply techniques from Microreact to tell a story. 

6.  Provide resources to aid healthcare workers visualise their data.

## **Introduction**

[Presentation](presentations/Telling a story and making a point.pdf)

**Principles of good story telling**

-   Keep it simple, where possible

-   Build up towards complex figures

-   Be consistent, but do not be repetitive

**Examples:** [Last chapter of the book "Fundamentals of Data Visualization" by Claus O. Wilke ](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html)

**Clever trick examples**

-   [sometimes cropping large values is justified](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2017/01/little-visualisation-design-part-32/)

-   [finding a common scale size and arrangement of all the charts](https://visualisingdata.com/2016/05/little-visualisation-design-part-16/)

-   [using a fading effect at the lower end of the chart](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2016/03/the-little-of-visualisation-design-part-5/)

-   [setting the y-axis maximum](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2016/03/the-little-of-visualisation-design-part-2/)

-   [using irregular axis scales](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2019/06/the-little-of-visualisation-design-part-64/)

-   [when it makes more sense to directly label the bars with their actual values](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2019/12/the-little-of-visualisation-design-part-69/)

This page is a repository for training resources designed and developed for the T3Connect courses.

[***T3Connect -- Data Science and Genomic Pathogen Surveillance Training Programme***](https://t3connect.org/#about) is a series of train-the-trainer courses, funded by [*UKRI*](https://www.ukri.org/), which aims to strengthen capacity in data science and pathogen genomics for applications in infectious diseases.

A collaboration between the [Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net/) and [Wellcome Connecting Science](https://www.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/), the programme applies the concept of forward training and equip professionals who interface with pathogen genomics data science with the skills needed to train others.

Five labs submit samples to a regional reference centre, for QC and bioinformatics analysis.

The data is received in a table format, from a live google sheet.

The regional reference centre processes the data and, for each sample, give an output of Pass / Fail.

The goals of this exercise are to 1) find out which labs have the quickest turn around times 2) find out if some labs lag behind quality control

Activity: Workflow based on your own professional setting (45 min, group work)

Participants are asked to form groups and describe a workflow based on their own professional setting from end to end. They should be looking for opportunities for quality control in the process described and how to assess success and failure.

Each group should present its findings to the rest of the classroom.

    "text": "Microreact can be used to describe a large collection of 1451 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, sampled from four countries (Colombia, India, Nigeria and The Philippines) between 2013 and 2019.\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is a species of bacteria that is commonly found in natural and man-made environments. It has the impressive ability to colonise diverse animal species, including ourselves, pets and livestock. In healthy humans, K. pneumoniae is frequently found on the skin, in the mouth, and in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. But K. pneumoniae is also an opportunistic pathogen, and can cause a wide range of infections in humans (and other animals). These include urinary tract, respiratory and bloodstream infections. \n\nIn recent years, there have been an increasing number of infections with K. pneumoniae that are resistant to antibiotics. One study found that carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae is the fastest-growing antibiotic resistance threat in Europe, with a 6-fold increase in the number of attributable deaths between 2007 and 2015. K. pneumoniae infections are particularly associated with patients who are very young (i.e. new-born babies), elderly, or immunocompromised.\nMicroreact demo link\nData taken from a series of articles published in 2021 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases:\n\nGlobal collection article\n\nPhilippines article\nIndia article\nNigeria article\nColombia article"

A collaboration between the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance and Wellcome Connecting Science, the programme applies the concept of forward training and equip professionals who interface with pathogen genomics data science with the skills needed to train others.\nTrain-the-trainer strategies provide an effective method for empowering scientists with tools and resources to pass on their knowledge and skills to their colleagues and multidisciplinary peers, thereby accelerating capacity for genomics in healthcare.\nThis FREE course provides participants with methods and techniques for training adult learners in analysis of genomics as applied in clinical management and public health. It integrates pedagogical aspects with pathogen genomic analysis, application and interpretation for management and surveillance of infectious disease. Participants will develop deeper knowledge of teaching and facilitation methodologies that they can later apply in their respective fields and work environments.\nTarget Audience\nThe course is aimed at researchers, healthcare and training professionals who are involved in any aspect of genomics or data science, and who are interested in building their capabilities to effectively share their knowledge and skills with others focused on pathogen genomic analysis, application and interpretation in management of infectious disease. This includes clinical, biomedical, and public health scientists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians.\nParticipants may also be involved in genomics technologies and computational biology training programmes, and interested in developing training resources for potential application of pathogen genomics in healthcare and public health."
